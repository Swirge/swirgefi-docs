# General FAQ

## What is SYRUP? <a id="what-is-syrup"></a>

When you stake your $SWFI, you auto-magically receive $SYRUP that will be used as proof-of-stake.

With the $SYRUP received you are able to stake for rewards in the SYRUP Pool.

## What happens if I sell my SYRUP?

Please do not sell/exchange your $SYRUP.

If you sell your $SYRUP you won't be able to unstake your $SWFI as you need the same amount of $SYRUP to do so.

## How can I stake SWFI? <a id="how-can-i-stake-cake"></a>

You can stake your SWFI on the "Staking" page by clicking on the little "+" sign after approving the contract, choose the amount you want to stake and confirm.

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

STAKING: In order to stake your $SWFI you don't need anything else than... well... $SWFI or $SWGb.

FARMING: In order to farm you need to provide liquidity to one of the pools on the farming page and then stake your LP tokens.

Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Which one to choose is up to your strategy.

## How do I farm?

In order to farm you first have to provide liquidity to one of the pools which you can find on the "Farm" page.

After providing liquidity and receiving your LP tokens then select the pool you joined from the "Farm" page, approve the contract and then click on the little "+" sign, choose the amount you want to stake and confirm.

## How do I set up my wallet on Binance Smart Chain?

Trust Wallet: When you go into the dAPP in the top-right corner you can see the different blockchains available, click on it then choose Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.

MetaMask: Create a custom RPC with the following: Network Name: BSC Mainnet New RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/) ChainID: 56 Symbol: BNB Block Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)

## Why is my transaction failing?

Check the TX on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)

If it says "burn amount exceeds balance" you forgot to unstake your $SYRUP. \(This if the transaction fails while trying to unstake $SWFI\)

If there is any other message it might be a problem within BSC, please try increasing the transfer fees to 20 GWEI 200,000 Gas limit.

## When will you open more pools?

There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.
