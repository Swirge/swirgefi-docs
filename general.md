## What Is Swirge Finance

Swirge Finance is a Swirge subsidiary focused on building decentralized financial products on the blockchain like a Multi-chain yield optimizer and staking platform operating on Binance Smart Chain and \( Avalanche and Huobi Eco Chain \). In return for a small fee, Swirge Finance Yield optimizer automates several investment strategies utilizing liquidity pools. This provides a huge advantage over attempting to do this manually yourself. Our team consists of bright mind individuals from various part of the world that is focused on building tools to decentralize the financial space. The team profile can be found here; [https://sale.swirgepay.com](https://sale.swirgepay.com) The project offers complex strategies that are simple and intuitive for any investor to take part in through the offerings on the platform. With the inherent advantage of speed with Binance Smart Chain, the team is exploring new methods of optimizing automation to secure the largest yields available. Binance Smart Chain offers some clear advantages in its speed and fees but still has its unique problems and challenges. As a decentralized project with a deeply ingrained crypto-mindset, there is a robust governance system in place to put the decision-making power in the hands of those invested in the project. This takes place through governance mechanisms related to Swirgeâ€™s native governance token $SWGb.

## Swirge Finance Decentralized Stable Coin Structure

Swirge Finance is also deploying first-of-its-kind decentralized stable coins using Solidity smart contracts that give the minting power and control to the community. The process is done in a way where a consensus is reached by the community on the value of the stable coin to the value of the United States Dollar \(USD\), the community then stake a portion of USDT Stable coins or BUSD stable coins in Swirge Stable coin Vault contract which then mints the stable coins in ratio to the agreed consensus to USD. The Vault contract now deploys the staked coins to generate profit for the minter. The newly minted stable coins can now be traded on exchanges or used by the community. To unstake your BUSD or USDT you will need to have in your wallet the equivalent of the stable coins initially minted, which now gets destroyed, and your USDT or BUSD tokens unstaked with the APY earnings. Example; Agreed consensus is 1 Stable coin = 480 USD User Stakes 1000 USDT which the Swirge vault will deploy certain strategies to maximizes profits for the user, 480,000 Stable coins are minted. For the user to unstake his 1000 USDT user needs to have 480,000 Stable coins. The user unstakes his 1000 USDT, the 480,000 Stable coins are destroyed. and users get back their 1000USDT plus Intrest. In other words, these stable coins will be backed by USDT and or BUSD, completely cutting off the need for a central authority. Swirge Finance will be launching; sNGN - Swirge Nigerian Naira Stable coins sINR - Swirge Indian Rupee Stable coins and sPKR - Swirge Pakistani Rupee Stable coins.

## Is Swirge Finance audited?

In deploying Swirge Finance we made use of already battled-tested codes, like OpenZeppelin and Beefy's contracts. All the contracts have their source code verified. Swirge Token \($SWGb\) was deployed using Justliqiuidity's already audited and verified smart contract. We also in talks with external auditors to get our strategy smart contracts and vaults audited too. [All Swirge audits can be found here.](https://github.com/swirge/swirge-audits)

### What is yield optimizer?

A yield optimizer is an automated service that seeks to gain the maximum possible return on crypto-investments made through DeFi platforms. They work much more efficiently than attempting to maximize yield through manual means. Each yield optimizer has its unique strategy for farming, which normally involves the reinvestment of crypto assets staked in liquidity pools. At the most simple level, it farms the rewards given from staked assets and reinvests them back into the liquidity pool. This compounds the amount of interest received and increases the amount staked that the yield is based on. A yield optimizer can repeat this up to process up to thousands of times a day. This fairly simple method is the reason behind the large APYs seen within yield optimization, otherwise known as liquidity farming. Compounding fees are amortized among all vault participants, making it cheaper for the user.

### What makes Swirge Finance different from other yield optimizers?

There are a few key reasons why Swirge Finance differs from a large number of yield optimizers out there today. 

1. Swirge Finance team is made up of more than 3 Smart contract developers with good experience in solidity, who carefully review and test our vaults, investment strategies, and smart contracts before releasing them to the public.
2. Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. The more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. Following beefy's key principle.
3. Beefy offers unique strategies that other yield optimizers simply do not have. This includes liquidity pool pairs that you can find only on the Beefy platform.
4. Yield optimization was originally commonplace on the Ethereum network. Huge gas fees however have made it impractical to use and costly. Swirge Finance works with Binance Smart Chain \(Avalanche C-Chain and Huobi Eco Chain\) to overcome the weaknesses present with Ethereum.
5. Swirge Finance deploys and manages the first-of-its-kind decentralized stable coins \(sNGN, sINR, sPKR\), and offers yield and staking options for these stable coins.

### What's the difference between APR and APY?

APR \(Annual Percentage Rate\) is the yearly interest, minus fees. This does not include compounding effects that occur from reinvesting profits. If you were to invest $100 with 100% APR, you would make $100 in profit. If you however reinvest your profits regularly, you will compound your interest. This calculated over a year gives you your APY \(Annual Percentage Yield\). The more often you compound your interest, the greater the difference between APR and APY.

### How does APY work?

APY is the annual percentage yield offered from a particular investment. This takes into account compound interest, giving you an accurate idea of your returns compared to simple interest. Large APYs in the percentage thousands are possible with investments that provide daily yields of 1-2%. Due to your liquidity pool rewards being constantly farmed and reinvested, the interest compounds on larger and larger amounts.
