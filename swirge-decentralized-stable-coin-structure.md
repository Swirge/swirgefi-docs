# Swirge Decentralized Stable Coin Structure

## Swirge Defi

Swirge Finance is working on deploying a first-of-its-kind decentralized stable coin structure using Solidity smart contracts that give the minting power and control to the community.

This will aid in the growth and quick adoption of the world to the Decentralized Finance space.

## How will the Stable Coins Work?

The process will be done in a way where a consensus is reached by the community on the value of the stable coin to the value of the United States Dollar \(USD\), the community then stake a portion of USDT Stable coins or BUSD stable coins in Swirge Stable coin Vault contract which then mints the stable coins in ratio to the agreed consensus to USD. 

The Vault contract now deploys the staked coins to generate profit for the minter using our various deployed strategy smart contract. 

The newly minted stable coins can now be traded on exchanges or used by the community. To unstake your BUSD or USDT you will need to have in your wallet the equivalent of the stable coins initially minted, which now gets destroyed, and your USDT or BUSD tokens unstaked with the APY earnings.

 Example; Agreed consensus is 1 Stable coin = 480 USD, User Stakes 1000 USDT which the Swirge vault will deploy certain strategies to maximizes profits for the user, 480,000 Stable coins are minted. 

For the user to unstake his 1000 USDT user needs to have 480,000 Stable coins. The user unstakes his 1000 USDT, the 480,000 Stable coins are destroyed. and users gets back their 1000USDT plus Intrest.

 In other words, these stable coins will be backed by USDT and or BUSD, completely cutting off the need for a central authority. Swirge Finance will be launching; sNGN - Swirge Nigerian Naira Stable coins sINR - Swirge Indian Rupee Stable coins and sPKR - Swirge Pakistani Rupee Stable coins..
