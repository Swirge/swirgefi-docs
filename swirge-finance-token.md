# Swirge Finance Token

## Introducing Swirge Finance Token \(SWFI\)

Due to the limited and capped supply for Swirge Token \($SWG or $SWGb\), We decided to launch a new Swirge Finance token that will aid in the growth of development of the Swirge Finance Platform and the Swirge ecosystem in general. The Swirge Finance Token will be a fair launch token with no pre-mine or team token allocation. You then ask how will this new token be minted? Upon creation of the Swirge Finance token, a farming pool will be deployed on Swirge Finance to enable SWGb holders to stake their SWGb tokens and yield the new Swirge Finance Token \(SWFI\) thereby minting new tokens into circulation. This of course will be the only initial method to mint the new Swirge Finance Token, and the entire process is controlled by various smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.

## The Swirge Finance Token-economics

There will be no pre-mine, team allocation, development allocation, Initial Coin Offering, or an IDO of any kind. 

The Swirge Finance Token will be used for governance on the Swirge Finance Platform and the Swirge ecosystem in general. There will be a weekly or monthly burn program of the Swirge Finance Token to aid in the control of the token emission process and also create scarcity. This burning process will be done automatically with the aid of smart contracts, which take into account a percentage of fees generated from Swirge Finance and excess minting and burn them. 

Swirge Finance token will aid us in growing the number of Staking pools on Swirge Finance and the number of Pools to Optimize.
