# SWFI Tokenomics

## **Emission rate** <a id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

\*\*\*\*

| **Metric** | **Emission/block \(SWFI\)** |
| :--- | ---: |
| Emission | 0 |
| Burned | -0 |
| **Effective Emission** | **&lt;0\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below 0 SWFI per block: a total 0,000 SWFI per day is diverted from the amount allocated to be distributed and burned. Details below.

### Per day <a id="per-day"></a>

| **Metric** | **Emission/day \(SWFI\)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Emission | 0 |
| Burned | -0 |
| **Effective Emission** | **0** |

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of SWFI is also minted to the [Dev address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x676797af81a1cc9811b6f0aca74db693fc8a86a4) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 SWFI are harvested, then 9.09 SWFI is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address. 

**However, all SWFI minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn** **and never enters circulation. As such, we have not included it in the above emission rate.**

##  <a id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to | Reward/block\(% of emission\) | Reward/block \(total SWFI\) | Reward/day |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Farms and Lottery | 0% | 0 | 0 \(approx\) |
| of which diverted and burned | ​ | ​ | -0 |
| Syrup Pools | 0% | 10 | 0 \(approx\) |
| **Total Daily SWFI Emission** | ​ | ​ | **0 \(approx\)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

At present, SWFI is also burned in the following ways:

* **100%** of SWFI sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of SWFI raised in IFOs
* **100%** of SWFI spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **20%** of SWFI spent on lottery tickets
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto SWFI Pool

{% hint style="info" %}
The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0xdb4f6f4da42ccb25b7a462942d81d229ea3ca9ce?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
